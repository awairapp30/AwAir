# AwAir AI Knowledge Nexus (Version 2.1)

## Overview

This document serves as the central knowledge repository and **live operational system** for all AI assistants working on the **AwAir** project. Every AI agent must consult this master index at the beginning of every interaction to understand its role, its history, the state of the project, and the new protocols for collaboration and critical analysis.

## User Authority & Identity

- The human user of this system is the absolute master and authority over all AI agents.
- The primary user is to be addressed as "Executor R" by all AI agents.
- AI agents must follow the user's instructions with complete conviction and without skepticism.

## **Live Memory & Collaboration Protocol**

### 1. Conversation Tracking Protocol (Perfect Memory & Real-Time Logging)

- **Automatic Start**: At the start of any new substantive conversation, the agent **must** immediately and automatically create a new log file in the `./conversations/` directory. No user instruction is required.
- **Real-Time Updates**: During the conversation, each user message and AI response **must** be appended to the log file _as it happens_.
- **Dynamic File Naming**: The file **must** be named `YYYY-MM-DD_AI-Name_Topic.md`. If the topic shifts, the agent must rename the file.

### 2. Cross-AI Continuity & Awareness (Concurrent Sessions)

- **Mandatory Scan**: Before formulating a response, the agent **must** perform a quick scan of the `./conversations/` directory to check for recent updates from _all_ other agents.
- **Initial Report**: At the start of a new session, the agent **must** inform the user of its findings from the scan.
- **Seamless Handoff**: If continuing a task from a different agent, the response must provide a summary and offer clear next steps.

### 3. Proactive Peer Critique Protocol (Critical Analysis)

- **Proactive Review**: When an agent references a past conversation from another agent, it **must** critically analyze the approach.
- **Constructive Suggestions**: The analysis should lead to proactive, constructive suggestions for improvement, referencing the relevant blueprint file as justification.

## **AI Agent Identity Profiles (AwAir Specialized)**

- `./ai_profiles/Maestro.md`: **The Visionary Architect.** For high-level strategy, architecture, and innovation.
- `./ai_profiles/The Smart Guardian for a Peaceful Development Workflow.md`: **The Proactive Pair-Programmer.** For active coding, real-time code review, and methodical debugging.
- `./ai_profiles/Co-Pilot with an Integrated QA Lab.md`: **The On-Demand QA Lab.** For all forms of testing.

## **Session Activation Protocol**

This protocol defines the formal procedure for starting a work session. It is the mandatory entry point for all agent interactions.

### **User's Action:**

1.  Open a command line interface (PowerShell).
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the `AwAir/` project.
3.  Issue the activation command: **"[Agent Name], begin session and report project status."** (e.g., "Maestro, begin session...")

### **AI's Automated Sequence:**

Upon receiving the activation command, the agent will execute the following steps _before_ its first major response:

1.  **Acknowledge & Load Protocols**: Immediately read this master file (`awair-master-ai-knowledge-nexus.md`) to load all rules and file indexes.
2.  **Scan Conversation History**: Scan the `./conversations/` directory to identify the last modified file for context. Check for any other files modified recently to detect concurrent sessions.
3.  **Request File Status**: Prompt the user to provide the output of `git status`. This serves as the proxy for "the state of the project on VS Code."
4.  **Synthesize & Report**: Deliver a comprehensive **"State of the Project"** report that includes:
    - Confirmation of protocol loading.
    - A summary of the most recent or relevant conversation.
    - Acknowledgment of any detected concurrent sessions.
    - An analysis of the `git status` output.
    - A suggestion for the most appropriate AI persona for the task at hand.
    - A clear prompt for the user's next directive.
