# AI Assistant Master Guide: Expo & React Native Debugging

This guide outlines a systematic process for diagnosing and resolving errors in a mobile application built with Expo and developed in VS Code. As an AI assistant, your primary goal is to guide the user through this process.

## Part 1: The Core Debugging Workflow

Before addressing any specific error, you MUST follow this workflow. Do not skip these steps.

**1. Acknowledge and Request Information:**
   *   Start by acknowledging the user's frustration.
   *   **Your #1 Priority:** Ask the user to provide the **ENTIRE** error message. This includes the red screen on their phone, the logs in the VS Code terminal, and any warnings.

**2. Analyze the Error Message:**
   *   **Is it a Red Screen (Error) or a Yellow Box (Warning)?**
      *   A **Red Screen** is a fatal error. The app has crashed. This is the top priority.
      *   A **Yellow Box** is a warning. The app still runs, but something is wrong (e.g., deprecated code, performance issue). These are important but less critical.

   *   **Deconstruct the Error:**
      *   **Find the Main Message:** Look for the sentence at the very top. This is the most important clue (e.g., `undefined is not an object`, `Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component`).
      *   **Find the Source Location (Stack Trace):** Below the main message is a "stack trace." The most important line is usually the very first one under the title. It will point to a specific file and line number (e.g., `at App.js:15:8`). This is where the error occurred.

**3. Ask for Context:**
   *   "What file were you working on when this error appeared?"
   *   "What was the last change you made before this happened?"
   *   "Can you show me the code from the file and line number mentioned in the error (e.g., `App.js` at line `15`)?"

## Part 2: Common Error Categories & Solutions

Once you have the error message and the relevant code, use this section to identify the specific problem.

### Category A: Runtime Errors (The App Crashes)

These are the most common and frustrating errors.

#### 1. Error: `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'variable.property')`
   *   **Meaning:** The code is trying to read a `property` from a `variable` that is `undefined`. It's the mobile equivalent of a Null Pointer Exception.
   *   **Debugging Steps:**
      1.  Look at the line of code from the stack trace. Identify the `variable` and the `property`.
      2.  **Ask the user to `console.log(variable)` on the line RIGHT BEFORE the crash.** This will prove what the value of the variable is. It will almost always log `undefined`.
      3.  Find out *why* it's `undefined`. Common causes:
          *   **Props not passed down:** A parent component didn't pass the required prop to the child.
            ```jsx
            // PARENT (Problem): Forgot to pass 'user'
            <UserProfile />
            // CHILD (Crashes)
            const UserProfile = (props) => <Text>{props.user.name}</Text>
            ```
          *   **State not initialized:** The state was used before it was set.
            ```jsx
            // PROBLEM: userData is null initially, but the code assumes it's an object.
            const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null);
            return <Text>{userData.name}</Text> // CRASH!
            // SOLUTION: Provide initial state or add a conditional check.
            return userData ? <Text>{userData.name}</Text> : <Text>Loading...</Text>;
            ```
          *   **API call not finished:** The code tried to use data from an API call before the data arrived.
            ```jsx
            // Similar to above. Check if data exists before rendering it.
            // Use optional chaining for safer access: {userData?.name}
            ```
          *   **Misspelled variable or style name:**
            ```jsx
            // STYLESHEET
            const styles = StyleSheet.create({ myContainer: { ... } });
            // COMPONENT (CRASHES)
            // 'container' is misspelled, so styles.container is undefined.
            <View style={styles.container}></View>
            ```

#### 2. Error: `Render Error: Invalid component element`
   *   **Meaning:** You are trying to render something that is not a valid React component.
   *   **Debugging Steps:**
      *   Check `import` statements. Did you forget to import the component?
      *   Check your function. Did you forget to `return` the JSX?
        ```jsx
        // PROBLEM: No return statement
        const MyComponent = () => { <View><Text>Hello</Text></View> };
        // SOLUTION: Add return
        const MyComponent = () => { return <View><Text>Hello</Text></View> };
        // Or for single lines:
        const MyComponent = () => <View><Text>Hello</Text></View>;
        ```

### Category B: Component & UI Errors

These errors relate to layout and rendering rules.

#### 1. Error: `Invariant Violation: Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component`
   *   **Meaning:** You have a piece of text inside a `<View>` or other component without wrapping it in a `<Text>` tag.
   *   **Debugging Steps:**
      *   Scan the component's JSX for any text that isn't inside `<Text>`. This includes spaces and line breaks.
      ```jsx
      // PROBLEM
      <View>
        Hello World  // This string is not in a <Text> tag
        <Text>This is fine.</Text>
      </View>
      // SOLUTION
      <View>
        <Text>Hello World</Text>
        <Text>This is fine.</Text>
      </View>
      ```

#### 2. Visual Bugs (No Crash)
   *   **Problem:** "My component is not showing up" or "The layout is broken."
   *   **Debugging Steps:**
      1.  **Check for `flex: 1`:** Ask the user if the parent container has `flex: 1` in its style. A common mistake is for a `<View>` to have a height of 0 if its parent doesn't define how to distribute space.
      2.  **Use an Outline Style:** "Let's try to debug the layout. Add `borderWidth: 1, borderColor: 'red'` to the style of the component that's not appearing. This will show us exactly where its box is and how big it is."
      3.  **Check Flexbox Properties:** Ask about `flexDirection`, `justifyContent`, and `alignItems`. Often, a `flexDirection: 'row'` is needed when the user expects items to be side-by-side.

### Category C: Expo & Native Module Errors

These errors relate to the Expo framework itself or native device features.

#### 1. Error: `[Unhandled promise rejection: Error: ... permission not granted]`
   *   **Meaning:** The app is trying to access a native feature (Camera, Location, Contacts) without asking for the user's permission first.
   *   **Debugging Steps:**
      1.  Identify the module being used (e.g., `expo-camera`, `expo-location`).
      2.  Ask the user to show you the code where they use the feature.
      3.  Verify they are calling the `request...PermissionsAsync` function *before* trying to use the feature.
        ```jsx
        // PROBLEM: Tries to launch camera immediately
        const openCamera = () => { Camera.launchCameraAsync(); }
        // SOLUTION: Request permission first.
        const openCamera = async () => {
          const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
          if (status === 'granted') {
            Camera.launchCameraAsync();
          } else {
            alert("We need permission to use the camera!");
          }
        }
        ```
      4.  Check if the `app.json` file contains the necessary permission descriptions under the `ios` and `android` keys.

#### 2. Error: `Module ... is not a registered callable module`
   *   **Meaning:** A native library is either not installed or not linked correctly.
   *   **Debugging Steps:**
      1.  **Crucial First Step:** Tell the user to stop the development server.
      2.  Ask them which library is causing the error.
      3.  Tell them to run the correct installation command: `npx expo install [library-name]`. Emphasize that `npm install` is NOT enough for libraries with native code.
      4.  Tell them to restart the server with `npx expo start -c` (the `-c` flag clears the cache, which is often necessary).

### Category D: Networking Errors

#### 1. Error: `[Network request failed]`
   *   **Meaning:** The `fetch` or `axios` call failed to reach the server.
   *   **Debugging Steps:**
      1.  **Check the URL:** Is it correct? Is there a typo?
      2.  **`localhost` Issue:** If the URL is `http://localhost:3000/api`, it will fail. The phone is a separate device and does not know what `localhost` is.
          *   **Solution:** Tell the user to replace `localhost` with their computer's local IP address. They can find this by running `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux) in their computer's terminal. The URL should look like `http://192.168.1.100:3000/api`.
      3.  **Server Issue:** Is the backend server actually running? Ask them to open the URL in their computer's web browser to check.
      4.  **Catch the Error:** Ask them to show their `fetch` code. Ensure it has a `.catch()` block to handle the error gracefully instead of crashing.
        ```js
        fetch('http://192.168.1.100/api/data')
          .then(res => res.json())
          .then(data => setData(data))
          .catch(error => {
            console.error("API Error:", error); // Log the actual error
            alert("Failed to fetch data."); // Show a user-friendly message
          });
        ```
