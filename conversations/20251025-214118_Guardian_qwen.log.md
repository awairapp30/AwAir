--- USER/SYSTEM: I'm ready to start building the HomeScreen component. ---

--- AI (Guardian): Understood. I am loading the blueprints for the `HomeScreen` component.  Before you begin, here is our pre-flight checklist to ensure a smooth build:  *   **Data Source:** This screen will fetch user profile data and recent activity from Firestore. It should also access the `soundscapes` collection for featured content. *   **UI Structure:** It needs a welcome header with user name, quick stats display, featured soundscapes carousel, and quick action buttons (Start Practice, View Progress, Settings). *   **State Management:** It will need to use `AuthContext` to get the current user, `AudioContext` for quick play controls, and `ProgressContext` to display user stats. *   **Navigation:** Action buttons should navigate to respective screens: Practice, Progress, and Settings.  My recommendation is to start by setting up the basic UI structure with placeholder data, then integrate the context providers and Firestore data fetching. Shall we begin with that? ---

**Status:** Completed
